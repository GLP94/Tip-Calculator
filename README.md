# Tip Calculator

This is my first project that has JavaScript. I am still not well versed with JavaScript, so I had to get some help with Copilot. Funnily enough, I would have not seen a typo if it weren't for it.

This is a tip calculator, which uses a slide to set the percentage of the tip, and returns the amount of tip and the bill in total with the tip added in.

## What was learned

1. It is possible to recall functions even if they were declared later in the script (Need to check more about it);
2. `Number()` converts anything in a number type, which made it possible to use the inputs in the HTML to make the calculations, since they give a string as a result.
3. Just a little about how generally a JavaScript code looks like.

## What needs work

1. Naturally, the fact that I used Copilot leaves a sour taste to the result. While it is an instrument that should definitely be put to use to make work better, I feel like if you're not capable of doing it yourself in the first place it's a waste;
2. Outside of defining consts and the first value change, I still get kind of lost in the code. Feels normal for being the first one. I should take on more projects.
